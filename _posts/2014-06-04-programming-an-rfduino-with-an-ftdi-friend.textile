title: Programming an Rfduino with an FTDI friend

There comes a time in every man's life when he buys a thing, thinking he won't need accessories, only to find out later that he does, in fact, need them. This was one of those times. 

I'd tweeted about building a bluetooth-enabled watch,and a friend linked me to the "RFduino":http://rfduino.cc, a device that seemed to fit all my requirements. It's small, low power, has enough GPIOs, and was supposedly open source. I'm not entrely sure that's true, as I know that you need a proprietary toolchain to build the  bootloader currently, but the bootloader itself is at least open. So, I decided to forge ahead with experiments anyway. I ordered two of the SMT versions.

When they arrived, I was stoked. They're freaking _tiny_ . My level of stoke only lasted until I started trying to find out how to program it; there wasn't much information at first, other than to use their programmer. A look at the "data sheet":http://www.rfduino.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RFD22301.Data_.Sheet_.11.24.13_11.38PM.pdf told me that it was just a USB->serial interface, and I had one of those, "Adafruit":http://www.adafruit.com's "FTDI Friend":http://www.adafruit.com/products/284.

To get it working, there are some steps. The Friend is already configured for 3v logic, but you have to solder some jumpers on the back to expose the right signal lines, and make Vcc 3v as well. In the picture, you can see I've bridged the DTR jumper pads with a surface mount part; that's a small value capacitor I had laying around. You don't have to do it that way, it just needs to be in series with the DTR line.

I derived most of the above from the datasheets for the parts involved, and then from some forum postings figured out the capacitor. Recommended but not required is a filter cap in parrallel between VCC and Ground. On my breadboard currently, there's also a pullup resistor from reset to Vcc, but that's not required. I was trying to troubleshoot... anyway. Protip: Command-u is not the same as Command-shift-u.

You could replicate the above with any of the FTDI programmers out there; sparkfun sells one, and there are clones all over. Just make sure it exposes the DTR line, and you're set.
